This project aims to investigate the human vision perception including visual optical system simulation, cone mosaic modeling, contrast sensitivity simulation based on Matlab environment. 

Additionally, we sim to develop image processing and reconstruction methods applied to the photopigments (photo sensors) on retina  using deep learning architects (CNN-autoencoder, GAN, UNet and Generative diffusion model) on Python environment.
